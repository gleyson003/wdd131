        <p>
            In our community there are many people who are in situations of hunger and poverty.
            Because of this, we decided to carry out a social project to collect food and clothes for these people through a volleyball championship.
        </p>
        <p>
            The championship will have teams formed randomly by registered participants. 
            A total of 6 teams must be formed and will compete against each other. 
            The winning team will be awarded tickets to attend the municipal theater's musical concert.
