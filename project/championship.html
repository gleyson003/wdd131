        <h3>Championship</h3>
        <p>
            The championship will consist of 6 teams of 10 players chosen at random from the registered participants. 
            It will be necessary for each team to define which players will be starters and which will be substitutes. 
            6 players must be starters and 4 substitutes. 
        </p>
        <p>6 days before the championship starts, the teams will be announced, and then players will be able to train together to learn how their team plays and create strategies.</p>
        <p> 
            Each team will play against all other teams. 
            Each set won will count as 1 point. 
            The two teams with the most points will play again in a final match.
